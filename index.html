        <h1>Born Between Two Worlds</h1>
        <p>The title born between two worlds captures Trevor Noah’s experience growing up between the worlds of
            black and and white in apartheid South Africa.. As a child of a black mother and white father his
            existence was illegal ,making him caught between racial and societal boundaries. The new title is a
            reflection of his identity struggles, sense of not fully belonging to one group and the complexities
            of growing up in a divided country.</p>

            <p>A<I>bel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife … ‘He only wants a woman who is free
                    because his dream is to put her in a cage.’</I></p>

            <p>The quote reveals a desire for control masked as love. It reflects how some men admire a strong and
                independent women but feel
                threatened by that strength and seek to dominate it.</p>

            <p> In today’s society this contradiction still exists. Many modern relationships begin with mutual
                admiration and equality, yet
                underlying gender expectations can still shape behavior. Some men are drawn to confident, ambitious
                women but later feel insecure
                by their independence. This often leads to control, ,limit or reshape their partner into a more
                “traditional” mold.</p>

            <p>A real life example of this contradiction is when a woman in a relationship is discouraged from pursuing
                a career because it might
                “neglect the family” even though the man was originally impressed by her ambition. This mindset
                reinforces outdated gender roles where
                men are expected to lead and for women to follow.</p>

            <p>The quote also makes you think if some people pursue relationships not for partnership but for
                power because true love should empower
                and support not dominate.</p>

            <p>In healthy relationships today equality and respect are key. While traditional roles may still work for
                some , they must be freely
                chosen not forced. The quote is challenging us to reflect whether we love people for who they are or for
                how well they fit our image
                of control.</p>
