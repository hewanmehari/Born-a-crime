            <h1> Born Between Two Worlds</h1>
            <p> • The title born between two worlds captures Trevor Noah’s experience growing up between the worlds of
                black and and white in apartheid South Africa.. As a child of a black mother and white father his
                existence
                was illegal ,making him caught between racial and societal boundaries. The new title is a reflection of
                his
                identity struggles, sense of not fully belonging to one group and the complexities of growing up in a
                divided country.</p>

            <div class="quote">
                <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left" id="up-quote"></i> <p>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife … ‘He only wants a woman who is free
                    because his dream is to put her in a cage.’</p>
                    <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right" id="down-quote"></i>
            </div>
            <p> • The quote reveals a desire for control masked as love. It reflects how some
                men admire a strong and independent women but feel threatened by that strength and seek to dominate it.
            </p>

            <p> In today’s society this contradiction still exists. Many modern relationships begin with mutual
                admiration and equality,
                yet underlying gender expectations can still shape behavior. Some men are drawn to confident, ambitious
                women but later feel
                insecure by their independence. This often leads to control, ,limit or reshape their partner into a more
                “traditional” mold.</p>

            <p>A real life example of this contradiction is when a woman in a relationship is discouraged from pursuing
                a career because it might
                “neglect the family” even though the man was originally impressed by her ambition. This mindset
                reinforces outdated gender roles where
                men are expected to lead and for women to follow.</p>

            <p>The quote also raises a big question: Do some people pursue relationships not for partnership but for
                power? True love should empower and
                support not dominate.</p>

            <p>In healthy relationships today equality and respect are key. While traditional roles may still work for
                some , they must be freely chosen not
                forced. The quote is challenging us to reflect whether we love people for who they are or for how well
                they fit our image of control.
